# Drug-Reviews-Classification
In this project, I have used ML-based NLP(Natural Language processing) algorithms for predicting the condition of a patient using the reviews he/she has given on a particular drug.I have perfromed a comparative analysis of all the models namely Naive Bayes Classifier, Passive Aggressive Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier out of which Random Forest Classifieer performed the best in terms of Accuracy.
The model has been deployed on Gradio server.
